Who is Mehmet ARICI?

Hello everyone, I'm Mehmetâœ‹</br>
About meðŸ’»</br>
- ðŸ’¬ I completed two departments at Sivas Cumhuriyet University. These;
Radio and Television Programming (Associate Degree),
Statistics and Computer Science (Undergraduate). 
I successfully graduated from both departments. Currently, I am a student at Konya Technical University Computer Engineering Master's program. I work as a software developer at Homework. I am on the way to become an experienced C# by working on desktop and asp.net on C#. In Python programming, I worked as a machine learning and twitter developer. I still continue my work whenever I have the opportunity. I also know HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript(basic level). I have studies on photography and video editing and digital content production. Since I mainly focus on software and technologies, I continue RTV as a hobby. I care about writing original code. Since I do research in my works, sometimes it is not original. While there is an advanced algorithm and if it is useful, I write original to the project while converting it to a project. I love learning new things.</br>
